class RubinGenericCamera(LsstCam):
    """Gen3 Butler specialization for the Rubin Generic Cameras

    Parameters
    ----------
    camera : `lsst.cameraGeom.Camera`
        Camera object from which to extract detector information.
    filters : `list` of `FilterDefinition`
        An ordered list of filters to define the set of PhysicalFilters
        associated with this instrument in the registry.

    While both the camera geometry and the set of filters associated with a
    camera are expected to change with time in general, their Butler Registry
    representations defined by an Instrument do not.  Instead:

     - We only extract names, IDs, and purposes from the detectors in the
       camera, which should be static information that actually reflects
       detector "slots" rather than the physical sensors themselves.  Because
       the distinction between physical sensors and slots is unimportant in
       the vast majority of Butler use cases, we just use "detector" even
       though the concept really maps better to "detector slot".  Ideally in
       the future this distinction between static and time-dependent
       information would be encoded in cameraGeom itself (e.g. by making the
       time-dependent Detector class inherit from a related class that only
       carries static content).

     - The Butler Registry is expected to contain physical_filter entries for
       all filters an instrument has ever had, because we really only care
       about which filters were used for particular observations, not which
       filters were *available* at some point in the past.  And changes in
       individual filters over time will be captured as changes in their
       TransmissionCurve datasets, not changes in the registry content (which
       is really just a label).  While at present Instrument and Registry
       do not provide a way to add new physical_filters, they will in the
       future.
